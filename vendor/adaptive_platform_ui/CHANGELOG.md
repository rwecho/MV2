# Changelog

## [1.0.2]
* **FIX**: iOS 26: the fixed toolbar's automatic back button is now a 44-point circle like the native one, instead of a 38-point rounded square, and sits level with the title. The page-owned toolbar's back button is circular too (@Anderzzon, #171)
* **FIX**: iPhone Duo: in Split View, an app in the left pane now shows its controls and tab bar in a vertical bar on the left edge, as native apps do. It used to fall back to horizontal bars. The side now comes from the system's vertical bar edge (iOS 27.1) instead of the safe-area insets alone (@sergi-labhouse)
  * Adds a Swift source file. With CocoaPods and a path or git dependency, if the iOS build fails with `cannot find 'VerticalBarEdgeStreamHandler' in scope`, run `pod install` in your `ios/` folder
* **FIX**: iPhone Duo: in the left Split View pane the package reserves the strip itself, as UIKit only adds that inset for bars it draws, so the page body and `SafeArea` stay clear of the bar. The controls start near the top of the pane, since there is no camera there (@sergi-labhouse)
* **IMPROVEMENT**: iPhone Duo: when the system gives no inset for the strip, its width now matches the system's 84 pt (it was 60 pt) (@sergi-labhouse)
* **FIX**: iOS 26: reversing an interactive back swipe under the fixed toolbar could throw `SemanticsNode._replaceChildren` with a screen reader on. Every layer of the fixed chrome now keeps its semantics attached, and the layer that is not in front is excluded explicitly, so VoiceOver never lands on invisible items. Reported and diagnosed by @Anderzzon (#166)
* **FIX**: iOS: `resizeToAvoidBottomInset` is now honored on the plain page branch (no app bar, no tab bar) and in the drawer wrapper, so a body anchored to the bottom is no longer lifted above the keyboard when it is set to `false` (@Danilo-Mota, #158)
* **FIX**: Fixed toolbar: dragging back from a page pushed over an `IndexedStack` tab layout showed the bar of the last mounted tab instead of the selected one (@DFelten, #164)
* **FIX**: Android: the plugin module now targets JVM 17 for both Java and Kotlin. Apps on AGP 8 / Kotlin 2 that force Kotlin to 17 failed with "Inconsistent JVM-target compatibility" (@goalbypro reported it in #119, @bryandelgado99 proposed the fix in #160)
* **FIX**: iOS: the selected `AdaptiveRadio` is drawn as a ring with an inner dot, as in UIKit, instead of a filled circle (@luflow, #154)
* **NEW**: `borderColor` and `borderWidth` on `AdaptiveCard` for iOS; the default stays a hairline separator (@luflow, #153)
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Example app adopts the UIScene lifecycle, matching Flutter's template (@luflow, #151)
* **FIX**: iOS 26 alert dialogs: the primary button now takes `CupertinoTheme.primaryColor` instead of a hardcoded system blue (@Qian-Samuel, #121)
* **NEW**: `badgeText`, `badgeColor` and `badgeTextColor` on `AdaptiveNavigationDestination`. Arbitrary badge text and colors on the iOS 26+ native tab bar (`UITabBarItem.badgeValue` / `badgeColor`), and the same fields drawn through `AdaptiveBadge` on iOS <26 and Android; a transparent `badgeColor` with a glyph gives a dot indicator (@terrykang90, #127)
* **NEW**: `menuItems` and `onMenuItemSelected` on `AdaptiveAppBarAction` turn an app bar action into a menu button: a native `UIMenu` on iOS 26+ (in the fixed toolbar and the iPhone Duo capsule too), an action sheet on iOS <26, a popup menu on Android (@DFelten, #163)
* **NEW**: `AdaptivePopupMenuDivider(title:)` names the group that follows it: an inline section title in the native iOS 26 menu, a heading in the action sheet on iOS <26, a heading row on Android (@luflow, #149)
* **NEW**: `selected` on `AdaptivePopupMenuItem` shows the current choice: the system checkmark in native iOS menus, a trailing check on Android, a leading check in the iOS <26 action sheet (@gem85247, #147)
* **FIX**: iOS 26 `AdaptiveButton` in child mode (icon or custom child): `minSize` is now a minimum instead of a fixed width (a `Size(0, h)` no longer collapses the button), and the content gets the same 16pt horizontal padding as the other platforms, so such buttons can come out slightly wider than before (@gem85247, #147)
* **FIX**: iOS 26 tab bar: the app's text direction is also written to `traitOverrides.layoutDirection`, so the selected Liquid Glass item follows the app locale when it differs from the device locale (@KhalidSaud, #140)
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Example app moved from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager (@luflow, #150)
* **NEW**: `AdaptiveContextMenu` on iOS 26+ is a native `UIContextMenuInteraction` with Liquid Glass: the child lifts as the preview and the actions are a `UIMenu` (title, SF Symbol, disabled, destructive). iOS <26 and Android are unchanged. Pass an SF Symbol name as `icon` for the iOS 26 menu (@itsatifsiddiqui, #161)
* **NEW**: The plugin now also gains `iOS26ContextMenuView`; CocoaPods users on a path or git dependency may need `pod install` to pick up the new Swift files
* **FIX**: Adding or removing `AdaptiveAppBar.actions` within the same page now reaches the iOS 26 native toolbar even when the list starts out `null`. Before, the change only showed after leaving and re-entering the page (#84)
* **FIX**: `AdaptiveScaffold` with a native tab bar mounted its body once per destination, so every page's `initState` ran as many times as there were tabs, and again on each tab switch. The body is now mounted once and kept across tab switches (#76)
* **FIX**: `AdaptiveSwitch` on iOS 18 and below is system green again instead of the theme's blue tint, matching every other switch on those versions (#94)
* **NEW**: `AdaptiveScaffold.extendBody` lets the body run under a custom floating bottom bar on Android and iOS 18 and below, so the bar's margins show the content instead of the scaffold background (#144)
* **NEW**: `AdaptiveScaffold.backgroundColor` sets the page background on every platform, including the iOS 26 native scaffold (#60, #95)
* **NEW**: `AdaptivePopupMenuButton.icon` takes `iconSize`, the glyph's point size on Android, iOS 18 and the iOS 26 native button (#139)
* **FIX**: Example: the Info page no longer overflows on the repository URL row (#50)
* **FIX**: `AdaptiveTabBarView` labels are readable on every background: on Android a custom or transparent `backgroundColor` now gets contrasting labels instead of white, and on iOS the selected segment's label contrasts with `selectedColor` (black thumb, white text). `unselectedColor` now reaches the iOS segments, and `selectedLabelColor` sets the selected label explicitly (#37)
* **FIX**: An opaque `AdaptiveScaffold.backgroundColor` also sets the status bar style, so a dark page in a light theme keeps light status icons. A page's own `AnnotatedRegion<SystemUiOverlayStyle>` still takes precedence (#77)

Who did what is in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/berkaycatak/adaptive_platform_ui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## [1.0.1]
* **FIX**: 📱 **iPhone Duo: the tab bar now lives in the vertical bar**, at the bottom of it, the way the system lays it out. In 1.0.0 it stayed at the bottom of the screen. The strip now reads, from the top: status cluster, back button, toolbar items, tab bar. Measured against a native UIKit app on the iPhone Duo simulator
* **FIX**: iPhone Duo: the vertical bar follows the hardware through every rotation. On the cover display in landscape it stays on the side, including the rotation that puts the strip on the left, and it keeps clear of the camera wherever the rotation puts it (top or bottom of the strip). In 1.0.0 rotating fell back to horizontal bars. The inner display in portrait keeps horizontal bars, as it does in UIKit
* **IMPROVEMENT**: iPhone Duo: toolbar items are grouped into native Liquid Glass capsules, one per group (groups are split by `spacerAfter`), with the back button as a round control on top, matching the system's sizes and spacing. The title moves to the leading edge, and content scrolling under it is blurred and faded like the system's scroll edge effect
* **NEW**: iPhone Duo: when the strip runs out of room, toolbar items move, from the bottom up, into the system overflow menu while the tab bar stays whole. A group can be split, so its first items stay visible
* **NEW**: `label` on `AdaptiveAppBarAction`, a short name such as "Undo". It names the action in the iPhone Duo overflow menu, for VoiceOver on iOS, and as the tooltip on Android. Unlike `title`, it never replaces the icon with text. Give every icon action one
* **FIX**: iPhone Duo: an action with only `icon` or `iconWidget` (no `iosSymbol`) showed up empty in the vertical bar
* **FIX**: A custom bottom bar (`useNativeBottomBar: false`) is left where it is on iPhone Duo; only the native tab bar moves into the vertical bar
* **FIX**: Example app: the Profile tab had no route, so Search could not be opened and Profile opened Search

## [1.0.0]
* **BREAKING**: The minimum iOS deployment target is now 15.0 (was 13.0). Xcode 27 no longer builds below 15.0. Set `platform :ios, '15.0'` in your `ios/Podfile` and `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 15.0` in the Runner project
* **BREAKING**: On iOS 26+ the native toolbar is no longer part of a page. With `AdaptiveApp`, every `AdaptiveScaffold` with `AdaptiveAppBar(useNativeToolbar: true)` hands its app bar to one fixed toolbar above the navigator. No code change is needed for ordinary pages. `AdaptiveAppBar.leading`, `titleWidget` and `AdaptiveAppBarAction.iconWidget` are now built above the navigator, so they must not look up `Navigator.of(context)` or page-level inherited widgets from their own `context`; capture the page's context in the callback instead. `useHeroBackButton` has no effect while the fixed toolbar is in use, because the back button already stays in place. See "Migrating to 1.0.0" in the README
* **NEW**: 📱 **iPhone Duo support.** Apple's foldable iPhone works out of the box, open and folded. On the inner display, and on the cover display while folded, toolbar controls move into a fixed vertical bar in the trailing strip the system reserves, clear of the camera and status cluster, while the title stays on top. Nothing to set up
* **NEW**: On iPhone Duo the scaffold keeps the page body out of the trailing strip, the way UIKit does, so a page that does not use `SafeArea` no longer runs underneath the status cluster and the vertical bar
* **NEW**: Fixed Liquid Glass toolbar on iOS 26+. One toolbar stays in place while pages slide underneath it, and only its items change. The outgoing page's items fade out and the incoming page's fade in, driven by the route's own animation, so the change lasts exactly as long as the page transition, follows a back swipe under the finger and reverses when the swipe is cancelled. A back button that both pages show stays put. Dialogs and sheets leave the toolbar in place, dimmed and not tappable
* **NEW**: `AdaptiveToolbarHost`, for apps that do not use `AdaptiveApp`. Install it in the app `builder`. It is router-agnostic: it relies on the widget tree only, not on a `NavigatorObserver`, so it works with `Navigator`, GoRouter (including `StatefulShellRoute`), auto_route, nested navigators and tabs
* **NEW**: `useFixedToolbar` on `AdaptiveScaffold` (default `true`). Set it to `false` for a scaffold that does not fill the screen from the top, such as one pane of a side by side layout, so it keeps its own toolbar. Scaffolds shown in a sheet, dialog or popup do this automatically
* **NEW**: Depends on `foldable` ^1.0.3 for the iPhone Duo reserved regions
* **FIX**: Builds with Xcode 27: `Package.swift` now declares its `FlutterFramework` dependency

## [0.1.111]
* **NEW**: Custom SF Symbols on iOS. `AdaptiveAppBarAction`, native buttons, and the tab bar now fall back to a bundle asset (`UIImage(named:)`) when a name is not a system SF Symbol, so custom symbols or images from the app's asset catalog work (@hieutbui)
* **NEW**: `iconWidget` on `AdaptiveAppBarAction` for a custom fallback widget (e.g. an SVG) on iOS <26 and Android (@hieutbui)
* **NEW**: Per-state SF Symbols on the iOS 26+ native tab bar. `AdaptiveNavigationDestination.selectedIcon` now accepts a distinct SF Symbol name for the selected state (outline when unselected, filled when selected) (@hieutbui, @philipgiuliani)
* **NEW**: `minuteInterval` on `AdaptiveTimePicker` and `AdaptiveDatePicker` restricts selectable minutes to a fixed grid (e.g. 15-minute steps). iOS uses the native `minuteInterval`; Android snaps the picked value onto the grid (@luflow)
* **NEW**: `AdaptiveDatePicker` now honors `dateAndTime` and `monthYear` modes on Android too, with `use24HourFormat` support (@luflow)

## [0.1.110]
* **NEW**: `subtitle` and `titleWidget` on `AdaptiveAppBar`. Show a smaller subtitle below the title, or replace the title area with any widget. Works on iOS 26+ native toolbar (centered overlay), iOS <26 `CupertinoNavigationBar`, and Material `AppBar` (@luflow)
* **NEW**: `subtitle` and `imageBytes` on `AdaptivePopupMenuItem`. Subtitles render natively via `UIAction.subtitle` on iOS 15+, and image bytes (e.g. avatars) are shown clipped to a circle on iOS 26+ native menus, Material popup menus, and the iOS <26 action-sheet fallback (@luflow)
* **IMPROVEMENT**: iOS 26+ native toolbar now insets the body's top padding by the toolbar height, so `SafeArea`/`SliverSafeArea` inside a page clear the Liquid Glass toolbar automatically, matching how `CupertinoPageScaffold` handles a translucent navigation bar. Removes the need for per-screen top-offset hacks (@luflow)
* **FIX**: Material alert dialogs now place the cancel (dismissive) button on the left, matching the Material 3 dialog guidelines (@luflow)
* **FIX**: iOS status bar style now follows the effective theme brightness on the Cupertino path, so it stays legible when a forced `ThemeMode` differs from the system brightness (@luflow)
* **FIX**: Fixed iOS 16+ popup menu items being reordered by the system by setting `preferredMenuElementOrder = .fixed`, so items keep their declared order (@Sahil-Kundaliya)
* **FIX**: Fixed an unbounded-width crash when an iOS 26 text popup button is placed directly in a `Row`, before its native intrinsic width has been measured
* **FIX**: Silenced an iOS 26 native button Auto Layout constraint conflict that logged on every layout pass

## [0.1.109]
* **NEW**: `triggerOnLongPress` and `onTap` on popup menu buttons — tap fires `onTap`, long-press opens the menu (@yuriylybimov)
* **NEW**: `isDestructive` on `AdaptivePopupMenuItem` — renders destructive (red) styling on Material, iOS <26, and iOS 26+ native menus (@yuriylybimov)
* **FIX**: destructive menu items now use the theme `colorScheme.error` instead of a hardcoded red (@yuriylybimov)
* **FIX**: `IOSSpringCurve` no longer clamps its output to [0,1], restoring the natural spring overshoot in the mid-range (endpoints remain exact) (@yuriylybimov)
* **NEW**: Exported `IOSSpringCurve` from the package's public API (@yuriylybimov)

## [0.1.108]
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Migrated the iOS plugin from CocoaPods to Swift Package Manager — apps with SPM enabled (`flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager`) now consume the plugin as a Swift package, while CocoaPods-based projects keep working unchanged (@philipgiuliani)
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Raised the iOS minimum deployment target from 12.0 to 13.0, matching Flutter's supported minimum (@philipgiuliani)

## [0.1.107]
* **NEW**: Added `resizeToAvoidBottomInset` prop to `AdaptiveScaffold` for explicit control over keyboard-driven scaffold resizing across all platform paths (iOS 26+, iOS <26, Android) (@philasmar)
* **FIX**: Fixed iOS 26+ native tab bar rendering with truncated/ellipsized labels on cold launch — replaced timing-based retry with a layout-aware container that rebuilds items when the platform view receives its real width (@philasmar)

## [0.1.106]
* **NEW**: Added `ImageProvider` support (`AssetImage`, `FileImage`, `NetworkImage`) for `AdaptiveBottomNavigationBar` icons — including async network image loading with caching and circular avatar rendering for iOS 26+ native tab bar (@philasmar)
* **NEW**: Added `textColor` and `selectedTextColor` props to `AdaptiveSegmentedControl` for explicit label color customization across iOS 26+, iOS <26, and Android (@philasmar)
* **FIX**: Fixed dimmed background removal delay when closing iOS 26+ alert dialogs — removed redundant Flutter-side overlays so only the native `UIAlertController` dim is used (@ctrl-Felix)

## [0.1.105]
* **NEW**: Added `ImageIcon` / `AssetImage` support for iOS 26+ native tab bar — custom asset icons (with optional per-state selected icon) can now be used alongside SF Symbols (@Mohamed-7018)
* **NEW**: Added automatic RTL (right-to-left) layout support for iOS 26+ native tab bar — mirrors automatically based on `Directionality.of(context)` (@Mohamed-7018)
* **NEW**: Added `hideBottomDivider` prop to `AdaptiveListTile` for removing the bottom separator, useful for the last tile in a grouped list (@ctrl-Felix)
* **NEW**: Added `separatorColor` prop to `AdaptiveListTile` for customizing the iOS bottom separator color (@philasmar)
* **FIX**: Fixed iOS 26+ alert dialog incorrectly tinting the cancel button red when no primary action was present (@philasmar)
* **FIX**: Removed unnecessary empty vertical space in message-only alert dialogs on Android and iOS <26 (@philasmar)
* **FIX**: Fixed iOS segmented control inactive label colors not following the app theme on iOS 26+, and removed vertical overflow on older iOS versions (@philasmar)

## [0.1.104]
* **NEW**: Added `tabBarHidden` prop to `AdaptiveScaffold` to hide the native iOS 26+ tab bar — prevents native `UITabBar` from bleeding through `showModalBottomSheet` (@DmitriiSer)
* **NEW**: Added `tintColor` support for iOS 26+ native toolbar and `prominent` button style for `AdaptiveAppBarAction` (@luflow)
* **FIX**: Fixed dynamic title updates not reflecting on iOS 26+ native toolbar (@Qian-Samuel)
* **FIX**: Fixed back button being obscured by window toolbar in iPadOS 26 windowed mode (@rivafarabi)

## [0.1.103]
* **FIX**: Fixed iOS 18 navigation bar not being displayed (@adrianorios)

## [0.1.102]
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Adjusted back button leading position on iOS 26+ native toolbar for better alignment

* **NEW**: Added `cupertinoDecoration` property to AdaptiveTextField and AdaptiveTextFormField for customizable iOS styling
* **NEW**: Added drawer and endDrawer support to AdaptiveScaffold with full Material drawer behavior on all platforms
* **FIX**: Prevented native tab bar from floating above keyboard on iOS 26+ (@marcofucito)

  * iOS 26+ with `useNativeBottomBar: true`: Native UITabBar with Liquid Glass effect is shown, custom `cupertinoTabBar` is ignored
  * iOS 26+ with `useNativeBottomBar: false`: Custom `cupertinoTabBar` is used if provided, otherwise auto-generated from items
  * iOS <26: Custom `cupertinoTabBar` is used if provided, otherwise auto-generated from items (useNativeBottomBar is ignored)
* **FIX**: Fixed icon type handling in bottom navigation
  * SF Symbol strings (e.g., "house.fill") are now properly converted to IconData for CupertinoTabBar
  * Android NavigationBar handles both IconData and SF Symbol strings with appropriate fallbacks
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `AdaptiveScaffold` bottom navigation parameters refactored
  * Removed: Direct `destinations`, `selectedIndex`, `onDestinationSelected` parameters
  * Added: Single `bottomNavigationBar` parameter of type `AdaptiveBottomNavigationBar?`
  * Migration: Wrap existing parameters in `AdaptiveBottomNavigationBar()`
  ```dart
  // Before
  AdaptiveScaffold(
    destinations: [...],
    selectedIndex: 0,
    onDestinationSelected: (index) {},
  )

  // After
  AdaptiveScaffold(
    bottomNavigationBar: AdaptiveBottomNavigationBar(
      items: [...],
      selectedIndex: 0,
      onTap: (index) {},
    ),
  )
  ```

* **NEW**: Added custom navigation bar support via `AdaptiveAppBar`
  * `cupertinoNavigationBar` parameter: Provide custom `CupertinoNavigationBar` for iOS
  * `appBar` parameter: Provide custom `AppBar` for Android
  * Custom navigation bars take priority over auto-generated ones

  * When `useNativeToolbar: false` or not set: Custom `cupertinoNavigationBar` is used if provided
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `AdaptiveScaffold` parameters refactored
  * Removed: Direct `title`, `actions`, `leading`, `useNativeToolbar` parameters
  * Added: Single `appBar` parameter of type `AdaptiveAppBar?`
  * Migration: Wrap existing parameters in `AdaptiveAppBar()`
  ```dart
  // Before
  AdaptiveScaffold(
    title: 'My App',
    actions: [...],
    useNativeToolbar: true,
  )

  // After
  AdaptiveScaffold(
    appBar: AdaptiveAppBar(
      title: 'My App',
      actions: [...],
      useNativeToolbar: true,
    ),
  )
  ```

  * Native toolbar can still be enabled via `useNativeToolbar: true` parameter in `AdaptiveScaffold`
  * Default behavior now uses `CupertinoNavigationBar` for better compatibility
  * iOS 26+ users will get custom animated back button when `useNativeToolbar: false`
  * Resolves touch callback issues and navigation conflicts with router-based navigation
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added automatic back button with fade animation for iOS 26+ when using `useNativeToolbar: false`
